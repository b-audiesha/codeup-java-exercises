public class Food {
}



//has private properties for String name, String description, and int calories
//takes in arguments in constructor in order to assign values to those properties (this.prop = value;)
//CONSTRUCTOR throws an IllegalArgumentException if any of the arguments are null or empty (note: integers cannot be null)
//You will need to both define the constructor as able to throw the exception and also conditionally actually throw the exception in the method body of the constructor
//create public getter and setter methods for each property
//HINT: there is a shortcut in Intellij that will do this for you
