//Create a class of static members (variables and methods) called DishTools
//  - AVERAGE_COST_OF_DISH_IN_CENTS - an integer constant set to 1300
//  - shoutDishName() - that takes in a Dish object and prints out the name in all caps
//  - analyzeDishCost() - that takes in a Dish object and will print out either “More expensive than average” or “Less expensive than average”, depending on the value of the dish costInCents compared to AVERAGE_COST_OF_DISH_IN_CENTS
//  - flipRecommendation() - that takes in a Dish object and reverses the wouldRecommend boolean value
//Try out the DishTools methods with Dish objects in the DishTest main method

// Static is very specific.
// Why would you use static over instance when static is so strict?
// If you were using data from a data base, you would use static
// if you think that the data will always be the same.
// If you are going to do the same
// thing a bunch of times in difference places.
// It will help you save lines of codes.
// When you need to change it, you only have to change
// it in one place versus in multiple places.
// You don’t want to have to keep making new connections
// to your data base.
//it is similar to like Math.pi and Math.random
// should really be used for single purpose only. You can also overload
// it to accomplish the same thing.
